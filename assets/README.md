# Assets Folder

## Employer Signature

Please add your employer signature image with the following specifications:

- **Filename**: `employer_signature.png`
- **Location**: Place it in this `assets/` folder
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (recommended)
- **Recommended Size**: 300x80 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- **File Size**: Keep it under 100KB for best performance

### How to add your signature:

1. Save your signature image as `employer_signature.png`
2. Place it in the `assets/` folder
3. The signature will automatically appear in the "Prepared by:" section of generated payslips

If the signature file is not found, the payslip will still generate correctly but without the signature image.
